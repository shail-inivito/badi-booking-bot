# Badminton Court Reservation Bot

This repository contains the code for automating the timeslot booking process for Badminton. The academy uses Zen planner so the code should theoretically be able to automate the booking for most other websites as well that rely on zen planner with little to no modification.

You need to install Selenium before you can use it:

```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install selenium
```

You might also have to download chrome webdriver and adjust the path on line 36 appropriately.

It is highly unethical to use an automated booking bot for reserving timeslots. This project was done as a learning process and I don't use this myself. Use this at your own risk.
